# RIDFinder
Find RID by account name.

## How to use?
You will need your account's RID and cookies to make this work.

Set `$rname` to the target account's name and enjoy!

By using this I assume you have some knowledge of coding, so that's all.

## I got RID, so what?
I don't know what you can do with RID, and I don't care.

**But please don't mess with the innocent players! <3**
